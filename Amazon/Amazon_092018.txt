Round1: Written Test

1. Testcase enumeration for credit card authorization System.
2. Write code to remove duplicates from a string. 
   Eg. Input: Call taxi. Output: Cal taxi. 
3. Write code to find largest sum from contiguous sub array.
4. Generate test data for time difference function.
5. Debugging scenario for YouTube video not playing

6. Given an array of size N. Say X is the minimum number in the array and Y is the maximum number
in the array. Write a program to find the number of elements in the range [x,y] occur at once.
	Example:
        Input: arr[]={6,4,5,8,3}
        Output: 1 (X=3 Y=8. Output is 1 as 7 is the only missing element between 3, 8)

	Input: arr[]={12,18,15,14}
        Output: 3 (X=12 Y=18. Output is 3 as 13,16,17 are missing elements between 12, 18)

7. Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns a string with uncommon characters of the input string
Example: String1="aabde"
         String2="cbaz"
Output: "decz"

8. Please come up with functional & non functional testcases for testing internet banking payment mode.

9. Come up with test data to test an API "validate_mobile number " that validates if the input given is a valid mobile number. (We don't need test cases. Provide test data)

10. While making Skype Video call from tablet, after ringing the call ends abruptly with white screen. Please come up with steps to debug the problem.

Round 2: Debugging and Problem Solving.

1. Given Array a[] = {1,2,3,7,10,-3,-1}
   In this pick the numbers out stating numbers at left is equal to summation of numbers at right.
   O/P is =7. i.e summation of left side number = 1+2+3 is 6 and summation of right numbers 10+3+1 =6
   so the output number is=6

2. Given a float f=2.1347f. Without using string inbuilt function, push the number to array including decimal point.
   O/p Array a={2,.,1,3,4,7,f}

3. I/P string ="This is a good book"
   O/P string = siht si a doog koob

To get output, we shouldn't use inbuilt string functions. Use recurrsion function.

4. Given an application and asked to write the different scenarios possible both functional and non functional.

5. We completed the testing for web based application that converts PDF file to HTML file.
We are done with testing and handed over the product to customer. For customer the PDF to html conversion doesn't happen 
and he reported it as an issue. So how this scenario will be debugged. Come up with debugging analysis process. 
 
6. Scenarios to check payment gateway using credit card

7. Program to find max number of times a number is repeated

8. Program to reverse alternate words in a string

9. Test data for email verification

10. Debugging: when u set alarm, the phone restarts how do u debug ?
