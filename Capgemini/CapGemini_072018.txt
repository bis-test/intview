1. How will you write the data into an excel ?

public class ExcelWriter3 
{

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException 
         {
		XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook();
		XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.createSheet("Java Books");

		Object[][] bookData = 
                {
				{"Head First Java", "Kathy Serria", 79},
				{"Effective Java", "Joshua Bloch", 36},
				{"Clean Code", "Robert martin", 42},
				{"Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel", 35},
		};

		int rowCount = 0;

		for (Object[] aBook : bookData) {
			Row row = sheet.createRow(++rowCount);

			int columnCount = 0;

			for (Object field : aBook) {
				Cell cell = row.createCell(++columnCount);
				if (field instanceof String) {
					cell.setCellValue((String) field);
				} else if (field instanceof Integer) {
					cell.setCellValue((Integer) field);
				}
			}

		}

		try (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("JavaBooks.xlsx")) {
			workbook.write(outputStream);
		}
	}

}



2. What is JavaExecutor ?
In Selenium Webdriver, locators like XPath, CSS, etc. are used to identify and perform operations on a web page.
In case, these locators do not work you can use JavaScriptExecutor. 
You can use JavaScriptExecutor to perform an desired operation on a web element.
Selenium support javaScriptExecutor. There is no need for an extra plugin or add-on. 
You just need to import (org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor) in the script as to use JavaScriptExecutor .

Java script executor is a class using which we can execute java script commands.
class RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver, JavascriptExecutor

Asynchronous
Execute Script


	//Creating the JavascriptExecutor interface object by Type casting		
        JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;		
        		
        //Launching the Site.		
        driver.get("http://demo.guru99.com/V4/");			
        		
        WebElement button =driver.findElement(By.name("btnLogin"));			
        		
        //Login to Guru99 		
        driver.findElement(By.name("uid")).sendKeys("mngr34926");					
        driver.findElement(By.name("password")).sendKeys("amUpenu");					
        		
        //Perform Click on LOGIN button using JavascriptExecutor		
        js.executeScript("arguments[0].click();", button);




3. What is Reflection class?
Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes
methods etc. at compile time. It is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and get/set field values using reflection.
The java.lang.Class class provides many methods that can be used to get metadata, examine and change the run time behavior of a class.

class Simple{}  
interface My{}  


class ReflectionDemo2 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException 
       {
		Class c=Class.forName("Simple");  
		System.out.println(c.isInterface());  

		Class c2=Class.forName("My");  
		System.out.println(c2.isInterface());  
	}
}



4. How will you handle windows popup?
If it is browser popup, using browser options we can disable the notifications
		//Browser options
		ChromeOptions op=new ChromeOptions();
		op.addArguments("--disable-notifications");
		ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(op);


If it is alert then we can accept or dismiss based on our requirement
		driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();
		driver.switchTo().alert().accept();



5. String s1="hello";
          s2="hello";
		  
s1==s2 -->retuns what?
s1.equals(s2) -> returns what?

Ans: First, the data type is missing for s2. We need to have String s2="hello"

s1==s2 -->retuns true
s1.equals(s2) -> returns true

	String s1="hello";
        String s2="hello";
        
        if(s1==s2)
        {
        	System.out.println("String matches 1");
        	System.out.println(s1==s2);
        }
        
        if(s1.equals(s2))
        {
        	System.out.println("String matches 2");
        	System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
        }


		  
6. There is a value in a web table, each row contains a radio button in the webtable.. 
   Using the value, how will you select that row's radio button.

+---------------------------------------+
|                Results                |
+-------------+-------+--------+--------+
| Swimming    |  1:30 |   2:05 |   o	|
+-------------+-------+--------+--------+
| Running     | 15:30 |  14:10 |   o	|
+-------------+-------+--------+--------+
| Walking     | 15:30 |  14:10 |   o	|
+-------------+-------+--------+--------+	

//td[text()='Running']/following-sibling::td[2]
OR
//td[text()='Running']/following-sibling::input[@type='radio']
	
7. Where will you store the webelements in your test case ?
Ans: Page Factory - Single language. xpath doesn't change.
     Properties file - Multi lingual applications. xpath changes like male, female. Bank bazar


8. How many test cases will you design per day ?
Ans: It depends on the complexity of the functionality, application specifications
     On an average we can design 2-3 testcases of high complexity
     4-5 if the testcase is of medium complexity
     6-7 if the testcase is of low complexity

9. How many cases will you execute per day ?
Ans: It depends on the project. On an average
     high level test cases-> 5 to 8 testcases
     medium level testcases-> 15 to 20 testcases
     low level testcases-> upto 30 testcases 

10.  How will you select the entered value from a text box ?
Ans: Using getAttribute("value") method
     WebElement email = driver.findElementById("email");
     email.getAttribute("value")

11. difference between getText and getAttribute..
Ans: 
	getText - Get the visible (i.e not hidden by css) inner text of the element 
          	  without any leading or trailing spaces. Text between the tags
	getAttribute - Get the value of the given attribute of the element. 

<input attr1='a' attr2='b' attr3='c'>foo</input>
getAttribute(attr1) you get 'a'
getAttribute(attr2) you get 'b'
getAttribute(attr3) you get 'c'
getText() with no parameter you can only get 'foo'

12. Notice period?
Ans: 60days. My project is ramping up and I can try negotiating with my project manager 
     to release me early.    

13. How will you estimate?
Ans: We categorize the user stories based on complexity. High-medium-low
Then the resource skill set is taken into consideration.
We keep the previous projects as a reference to check how much time the functionality would check.
Then the hours estimation is done.
We also keep few hours as buffer and few hours for meetings/management.


14. Write Xpath using contains?
Ans: "//h4/a[contains(text(),'SAP M')]"


15. How to enter OTP using selenium web driver?

| User Name |__________|                            ________ 
             __________        ----->    Enter OTP |________|
| User Name |__________| 
 	 _______
	|_Logon_|

To enter OTP numbers, the numbers will be encrypted. So we need to create a new popup
which should be like this
            __________
 Enter OTP |__________|                          
  
	 ____
	|_OK_|

We will enter the OTP and then press OK so it will take the value and fill in the OTP text box 
of the application and continue.


16. Get the value ABCD from child window C and then move back to the parent window.

.....................
. A                 .               
. ................. .          
. . B             . .              
. .               . . 
. .  ........     . .
. .  .C ABCD.     . . 
.    ........     . .            
. . ............... .               
.                   .
.....................


String parentwindow= driver.getWindowHandle();

	Set<String> Allwindow = driver.getWindowHandles();
	List<String> listwindow = new ArrayList<String>();

	listwindow.addAll(Allwindow);
        int size = listwindow.size();
        System.out.println("The number of windows =" +size);
    
        String secwin = listwindow.get(1);
        driver.switchTo().window(secwin);

        System.out.println("I am at = "+driver.getTitle());


	Allwindow = driver.getWindowHandles();
	listwindow = new ArrayList<String>();

	listwindow.addAll(Allwindow);
        size = listwindow.size();
        System.out.println("The number of windows =" +size);
    
        String thwin = listwindow.get(2);
        driver.switchTo().window(thwin);
		
	System.out.println("I am at = "+driver.getTitle());


	WebElement head = driver.findElementById("head");
	System.out.println(head.getText());
		
	driver.switchTo().window(parentwindow);
	System.out.println("I am at = "+driver.getTitle());

        driver.close() //will close current window
        driver.quit() //will close all windows


17. Explain framework
Ans: Draw the diagram of a hybrid framework and explain in detail.

18. Suppose you have 600 testcases. How will you run in parallel.
Ans: In the testNG.xml file we can specify that.
<suite name="Parallel test suite" parallel="methods" thread-count="2">
  <test name="Regression 1">
    <classes>
      <class name="com.parallel.TestParallelOne"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>

parallel = can be methods/classes or tests.

18. Explain git. Suppose both the members use/modify same code what will happen? 

Git is a version control System (VCS). It is a repository of the code base that allows to track changes.
It is really easy to track who changed it, what is changed, when it was changed etc.
Multiple people can work on a single project  

If both the people modify the same code then, it will create merge conflict.
It will show the code this way and we can keep the version we want to.

If you have questions, please
<<<<<<< HEAD
open an issue
=======
ask your question in IRC.
>>>>>>> branch-a

19. What is Jenkin? what are the possible ways to run?

Jenkin is a build tool. It can trigger the test scripts automatically  when some code change happens
and send email to the interested parties.

We can schedule the jobs to run. It saves all the build history (execution report/test report).


20. Explain OOPS concept of java in one single program.

There are many oops concepts like - class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Aggregation, Composition


abstract class Bank
{  
	abstract float rateOfInterest();  
}  
class SBI extends Bank{  
	public float rateOfInterest(){return 9.15f;}  
}  
class PNB extends Bank{  
	public float rateOfInterest(){return 9.7f;}  
}  

public class OopsConcepts 
{

	public static void main(String[] args) 
       {

		Bank b=new SBI();  
		System.out.println("ROI: "+b.rateOfInterest());  
	}  

}

21. What is set & list?

Set is a collection interface. Two types - Hash Set, Tree Set
Hash set is unique value. Fast beacuse it works with heap storage.
Tree set is unique value & Ascending order & comparatively slower.
We have methods like - add, addAll, isEmpty, remove, clear, first, last, size

HashSet<String> set=new HashSet<String>();  
TreeSet<String> al=new TreeSet<String>();  
al.add("Ravi");   
al.add("Priyanka"); 
	Iterator<String> itr=set.iterator();  
  	while(itr.hasNext())
        {  
   	System.out.println(itr.next());  
  	}  

List is a collection interface. Two types - Array list, linked list
Allows duplicates.
Has methods like - add, addAll, clear, isEmpty, remove, sort, size

ArrayList<String> al=new ArrayList<String>(); 
LinkedList<String> al=new LinkedList<String>(); 
al.add("Ravi");  
al.add("Vijay");  
for(String obj:al)  
System.out.println(obj);   

22. How to sort the dates in java

Ans:Pending

23. a--bcd$----cd. If I want single spaces instead of multiple spaces.

Ans: 
        String str = "a  bcd$            cd.";
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, " ");
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        while(st.hasMoreElements()){
            sb.append(st.nextElement()).append(" ");
        }
        System.out.println(sb.toString().trim()); 

24. Having 100 objects having employee id & name. How to sort using employee id.

http://www.thejavageek.com/2013/06/17/sorting-user-defined-objects-part-2/

25. Access Modifiers

26. Window handling. Why are we using list and set. Without list can we achieve?

It prevents possible handlers duplication in the collection which may cause multiple invocations of the same handler after every event. 
List can has duplicated elements and Set can't.

Afer storing in set, we store in list because the get(index) method is not available in set.

Set<String> Allwindow = driver.getWindowHandles();
List<String> listwindow = new ArrayList<String>();
listwindow.addAll(Allwindow);
String secwin = listwindow.get(1);
driver.switchTo().window(secwin);

27. Implicit & explicit wait? This both does the same. What is the difference.

Implicit wait --

Implicit waits are basically your way of telling WebDriver the latency that you want to see if specified web element is not present that WebDriver looking for. 
So in this case, you are telling WebDriver that it should wait 10 seconds in cases of specified element not available on the UI (DOM).

Explicit wait--

Explicit waits are intelligent waits that are confined to a particular web element. 
Using explicit waits you are basically telling WebDriver at the max it is to wait for X units of time before it gives up.
 

28. What are the challenges you have faced?

- Uploading files 
		WebElement file = driver.findElementByXPath("//input[@type='file']");
		file.sendKeys("C:\\RESUME.docx");

- screen shot of alert
		// create object to robot class
		Robot rb = new Robot();

		// create rectangle for full screenshot
		Rectangle screenRect = new Rectangle(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize());

		// capture screen of the desktop
		BufferedImage screenFullImage= rb.createScreenCapture(screenRect);

		// save the screenshot to local system
		ImageIO.write(screenFullImage, "png", new File("./snap/Alert1.png"));

-Verifying OTP
         Created another layer, so a prompt will ask the OTP and user can enter

- Verifying captcha 
         
         Created another layer, so a prompt will ask the OTP and user can enter

- We were having performance issues and after investigating itwas found the database threads
were open and not closed. So it was having memory leaks 


29. What are the classes available in selenium

ChromeDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorer
WebDriverWait
Throwable
Exception
RunTimeException
WebdriverException
NoSuchElement exception


30. What are the annotations used in cucumber

Ans: Annotation is a predefined text, which holds a specific meaning. 
It lets the compiler/interpreter know, what should be done upon execution. 
Cucumber has got the following few annotations -

Given - It describes the pre-requisite for the test to be executed.
        Example - GIVEN I am a Facebook user

When -  It defines the trigger point for any test scenario execution.
        Example - WHEN I enter "<username>"

Then -  Then holds the expected result for the test to be executed.
        Example - THEN login should be successful.

And -   It provides the logical AND condition between any two statements. 
	AND can be used in conjunction with GIVEN, WHEN and THEN statement.
        Example - WHEN I enter my "<username>" AND I enter my "<password>"

But -   It signifies logical OR condition between any two statements. 
        OR can be used in conjunction with GIVEN, WHEN and THEN statement.
        Example - THEN login should be successful. BUT home page should not be missing.

Scenario - Details about the scenario under the test needs to be captured after the keyword “Scenario:”
           Example -
           Scenario:
           GIVEN I am a Facebook user
           WHEN I enter my
           AND I enter my
           THEN login should be successful.
           BUT home page should not be missing.

Scenario Outline - Use data input

Background - Background generally has the instruction on what to setup before each scenario runs. 
             However, it gets executed after “Before” hook (to be covered later). 
             So this is ideal to be used for code when we want to set up the web-browser 
             or we want to establish the database connectivity.

	     Example -   Background:
             Go to Facebook home page.

34. Write a sorting program

public class BubbleSortExample {  
    static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {  
        int n = arr.length;  
        int temp = 0;  
         for(int i=0; i < n; i++){  
                 for(int j=1; j < (n-i); j++){  
                          if(arr[j-1] > arr[j]){  
                                 //swap elements  
                                 temp = arr[j-1];  
                                 arr[j-1] = arr[j];  
                                 arr[j] = temp;  
                         }  
                          
                 }  
         }  
  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
                int arr[] ={3,60,35,2,45,320,5};  
                 
                System.out.println("Array Before Bubble Sort");  
                for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++){  
                        System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");  
                }  
                System.out.println();  
                  
                bubbleSort(arr);//sorting array elements using bubble sort  
                 
                System.out.println("Array After Bubble Sort");  
                for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++){  
                        System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");  
                }  
   
        }  
}  

35. What is list in this code?
     ArrayList<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();

ArrayList is the class. list is the object using which we can access class methods.
