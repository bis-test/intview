Q. Lambda expressions?

Java lambda expressions are new in Java 8. Java lambda expressions are Java's first step into functional programming. A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class. A Java lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.

Java lambda expressions are commonly used to implement simple event listeners / callbacks, or in functional programming with the Java Streams API.

public class LambdaExpression {

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		List<String> name= new ArrayList<String>();
		name.add("Priyanka");
		name.add("Parineeti");
		name.add("Kareena");

		name.forEach(eachName-> System.out.println(eachName));

	}
}
